We enable things like HubSpot’s chat and collaboration products, live scores for millions of Australian Open tennis fans, and real time transit updates for three million Chicagoans. Engineers at some of the largest companies in the world choose Ably because, when it comes down to it, we’re the only platform that dependably delivers on the most demanding realtime requirements at global, production scale.</p>\n<p>The opportunity in front of us is immense. Our mission is to become the definitive realtime infrastructure of the internet while powering and accelerating the emerging ecosystem. We’re on track. Today we deliver billions of realtime messages to more than 50 million people across web, mobile, and IoT platforms. But we can’t rest yet. In five years we want to reach one billion people everyday</p>\n<p>To see what life’s like at Ably, check out our careers page at <a href=\"http://www.ably.io/careers\">www.ably.io/careers</a>.</p>\n<p>What we do</p>\n<p>Ably’s engineering team is deeply technical, collectively bringing a wealth of experience and broad technology skills across infrastructure, security, distributed systems, and much more. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites and motivates us each day. If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably.</p>\n<p>In this role</p>\n<p>You will report to the Head of Infrastructure and will have responsibility for all aspects of Ably’s infrastructure services. Together, these provide compute capacity, networking, and all ancillary services required to operate the core services and support the complete development cycle for all Ably products and services.</p>\n<p>You will be successful if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a deep technical understanding of how systems work top-to-bottom and are committed to</li>\n<li>continuing to advance that understanding</li>\n<li>Enjoy getting your hands dirty, getting things done, and seeing your creations from inception through to production use by consumers’ apps</li>\n<li>Understand the Site Reliability Engineering discipline (<a href=\"https://go.ably.io/what-is-sre\">https://go.ably.io/what-is-sre</a>) and are excited by the idea of infrastructure-as-code and no manual maintenance of systems.</li>\n<li>Care about technical excellence in your work and fitness for purpose in your code</li>\n<li>Want to join a team that’s on a mission to provide the best possible service for our customers</li>\n<li>You will be expected to participate in an on-call rotation after your onboarding and training phase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Technical skills needed</p>\n<p>Ably is a cloud-native business with infrastructure that is almost wholly cloud-based, and we expect that to remain the case, at least in the near and medium term. Therefore, you must be intimately familiar with operations at scale on public cloud infrastructure, using the full range of functionality from the public cloud providers.</p>\n<p>This is not a traditional sysadmin role, we expect software engineering skills. You will be working to support the work of our product engineering teams, so you will need a strong understanding of their pressures and needs. Ably’s infrastructure operations are based currently on internally-developed software for deployment and orchestration, instance management and health monitoring, plus administration of the multiple ancillary systems used to operate the service. Therefore, you need to be a developer first, and have an established record of software development in production systems.</p>\n<p>As with all of our developer roles, we strongly prefer candidates that have a track record of working with open source, either with their own projects or contributions to community projects.</p>\n<p>Much of our existing infrastructure management code is written in Ruby and Go. We very much would like to see Ruby experience, even if not as a main language, and Go experience is advantageous.</p>\n<p>Our infrastructure runs in the public AWS cloud and therefore we need to see in-depth experience of operating production systems in the public cloud, and a detailed understanding of the full range of cloud services we use. Our software runs in large clusters and in AWS regions around the world, so experience with the engineering challenges of large, geographically distributed systems is valuable.</p>\n<p>We expect you to be very strong technically in Linux systems administration and networking.</p>\n<p>Nice to have skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Containerisation, Docker;</li>\n<li>Orchestration with Kubernetes or similar frameworks;</li>\n<li>Go, Node.js and Bash;</li>\n<li>Cassandra;</li>\n<li>Experience with CI/CD systems;</li>\n<li>Our team are active open source contributors and are encouraged to do this as part of their role at Ably. We like new team members who enjoy contributing back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What’s it like to work at Ably?</p>\n<p>Founded by two engineers who spotted a hard and largely unsolved problem, Ably is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide the infrastructure required for a high-bandwidth, always-connected world, we hire engineers with a broad set of technical skills who are ready and capable of taking on challenging realtime engineering problems.</p>\n<p>As a company and engineering team we’re committed to a future internet that’s open, with all engineers contributing to existing open source projects.</p>\n<p>We want to work in a company of inclusive people who treat each other well. As an Ablyan, you’ll enjoy taking ownership and making an impact, with work that is both varied and challenging. And to really thrive at Ably, you’ll need to believe in and be prepared to do your work in line with our values, which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open For All. Open is a mindset. When open, we’re better collaborators, communicators and creators. Whether open source, standards, or protocols, open hearts, minds, and eyes. It’s better when it’s open.</li>\n<li>Bias For Action. We avoid analysis paralysis at all costs. We lean into doing in order to move us forward. When we have enough of what we need to act, we act.</li>\n<li>Even The Best Do Better. We want to be the best - but that doesn’t mean we rest when we are. Improvement and growth - true betterment - is an ongoing journey. One fuelled by curiosity and taking risks.</li>\n<li>Technology Needs Humanity. Our technology means little without people - whether that’s how we treat our colleagues, or how we design developer experiences. Being human matters.</li>\n<li>Dependable People Make Dependable Things. Dependability is integral to our mission and technology, but being dependable starts with our people. When we care enough to take real ownership of our products and problems - all else will follow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What’s in it for you?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A good, competitive salary</li>\n<li>A great company culture</li>\n<li>Share options</li>\n<li>A remote first company. Unless you want to pop into our communal office space in Shoreditch, you'll work from home most of the time, apart from when we have planning sessions and summits.</li>\n<li>Health insurance, including Doctor@Hand</li>\n<li>Employee Assistance Programme</li>\n<li>Wellness benefit</li>\n<li>Regular company away days and social events</li>\n<li>Weekly team drinks and snacks</li>\n<li>Ongoing professional development (training, events, conferences)</li>\n<li>Charity volunteer day</li>\n<li>25 days of paid annual leave (33 days including bank holidays)</li>\n<li>Company contributions towards your pension</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you enjoy working as part of a technology company, value open source, and love solving hard problems - then we’d love to hear from you, regardless of whether you fit the spec exactly or not.

We're looking for a Software Engineer to join our small team to build, own and scale the distribution of Raycast extensions via a store that developers around the world can contribute to.</p>\n<p>Raycast is a native Mac application with a significant focus on top-notch UI and interactions. We genuinely care about user experience, performance, privacy and ease of use. We had enough of dealing with slow and clunky tools. Raycast is our attempt to let you enjoy your daily workflows without all the distractions.</p>\n<p>When Apple announced the App Store in 2008, the distribution of software changed over night. Suddenly, developers could reach millions of customers. We believe it's about time to change how developers discover and consume productivity tools. At the center of this, is a store full of Raycast extensions that people can share and manage or discover new ones from others. We need hungry engineers that architect and build this store to revolutionise how developers experience productivity tools with us.</p>\n<p>We're a fully remote company and looking for candidates in the UTC timezone (London, Lisbon, Dakar, ...) ± 3 hours. This position is for a full-time employment.</p>\n<h2>In this role you will...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Build the infrastructure of our store.</strong> You design a stable cloud infrastructure and backend architecture that is open for extension, and an API that other developers love to use. You're implementing the distribution of our extensions and work closely with macOS engineering where needed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Co-own the product and work self-directed.</strong> We're a small team of individual contributors. Everybody has autonomy and responsibility. You work on features from ideation over release to maintenance and shape the roadmap of the product.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Shape the experience for contributors.</strong> The store is one piece of the puzzle. You generate ideas about how developers should add and maintain extensions. You optimise for ease-of-use for producers and consumers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improve performance and care about quality.</strong> You dogfood your own features with our nightly builds, respond to user feedback in our community and jump into performance profiling to make API calls fast. You automate tedious tasks. At best, directly in Raycast.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Wear many hats.</strong> In a small startup, we're all generalists. You might add a new page to our Vue.js website, set up infrastructure components, or write a blog post about a new feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>You will be a great fit if...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>You know how to build great APIs.</strong> Ideally, you've built and scaled APIs before and have a playbook to kickstart development with modern backend languages. You've worked with different types of data stores, and you know best practices around data modeling and access. Moreover, you can reason well about the tradeoffs of different programming languages and tech stacks without being dogmatic, f.e. decide if we should adopt GraphQL or REST.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You're highly productive while writing quality code.</strong> We release updates every 1-2 weeks. You can break down big projects in small deliverables. You care about the outcome and take a pragmatic approach to deliver it. You keep things simple and rather write more code than adopting a third-party dependency. You know when you want a code review or need to write tests.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You're product-minded.</strong> You have a sense for great user experience and feel when something is off. You work with continuous deployment and preview environments to get constant feedback and you have monitoring and analytics in place to quickly act when something unexpected happens. You're eager to optimize API responsiveness and dig deep when there is a need to resolve a tricky issue. You treat APIs as products and proactively iterate on them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You put our users first.</strong> Throughout Raycast you find many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raycastapp/status/1322188380403281921?s=21\">little details</a>. You pay attention to detail and provide our users a delightful experience. You can't stand bugs and don't shy away from user feedback.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You're an empathetic communicator.</strong> You treat technology as tradeoffs. You may be opinionated but you're not ideological. When disagreeing, you communicate thoughtfully your perspective and compromise when needed. You're thriving in a team environment and hold your colleagues accountable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Our stack</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>JavaScript/TypeScript for the web.</strong> So far, most of our web development happened on our marketing website. We're <strong>open to adopt new technologies</strong> for the store where applicable. For now, we use Vue.js with Gridsome for our website and deploy it with Vercel. Our middleware is a simple Node.js app written with Express and hosted on Heroku.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Swift for our macOS app.</strong> Everything is written in Swift using AppKit with Swift Packages. We don't use SwiftUI because it's too premature for rapid development. We rarely adopt third party dependencies. Some are GRDB for our database, Sentry for crash reporting, Nuke for image fetching and a few C libraries to crank up performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Modern work tools for everything.</strong> Linear for issue tracking, GitHub as source control, Sentry for error reporting, Segment and Amplitude for analytics, Slack for internal communication, Figma for pixels, Notion as knowledge base and a few others.
